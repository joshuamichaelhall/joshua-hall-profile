### Post Templates

#### Federal Security Implementation Post
```
🔒 Built CMMC-compliant AWS architecture for defense contractors.

Challenge: NIST 800-53 AC.2.016 "Control the flow of CUI in accordance with approved authorizations"

Implementation:
- VPC with security groups mapped to authorization matrix
- CloudTrail logging with integrity validation
- WAF rules documenting flow control decisions
- GuardDuty for unauthorized flow detection
- Complete evidence documentation for assessors

Result: Assessment-ready architecture with automated compliance checking

#### Zero-Breach Operations Post
```
🛡️ Maintained zero ransomware incidents across 30+ clients consistently.

Real scenario: Client called with "mouse moving by itself" - remote access attack in progress.

Discovery:
• 30 employees sharing 2 RDP accounts
• Password on sticky note, posted on wall
• No network segmentation, no patching
• Multiple unsupported operating systems

Response:
• Immediate threat containment and isolation
• Complete infrastructure overhaul
• Implemented MFA, RMM, SOC monitoring
• Zero incidents post-implementation

This operational experience translates directly to federal requirements.
